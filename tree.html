			      <p>Native to Southeast Asia,  I am grown in several tropical regions nowadays, primarily for my fruit. The fruit, which is referred to as a &#127820;, is also exported to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe. Restricted to the tropical countries of Southeast Asia at one point of time, I am now grown in as many as 107 countries across the world.</p>

			    <div class="col-md-8">
			      <p>I belong to the Musa genus of the Musaceae family. Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana are the wild species of me, and whatever of my cultivars that are grown today are believed to have descended from these two. You might come across several sources which state that my scientific name is Musa sapientum, which was the case earlier. The same is no longer in use.</p>
